      <h2>Our goal is to help Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) minimize reliance on paper records by providing a digital, efficient, and user-friendly
         system for managing patient data and appointments. With an intuitive interface, BHWs can easily record, update, and retrieve patient
          information without the hassle of handling physical documents. By automating record-keeping, scheduling, and reporting, 
          we aim to reduce administrative workload, prevent data loss, and improve accessibility. This system ensures that health workers can focus 
          more on delivering quality healthcare services while maintaining organized and accurate records.</h2>
